  "comment": "All required parameters for both MP-GenIC and MP-Gadget are now included and validated against the MP-Gadget user manual (sections 4 and 5). OutputDir, FileBase, FileWithInputSpectrum, and Seed for GenIC, as well as InitCondFile, OutputDir, OutputList, and TimeLimitCPU for Gadget, are user/environment-specific and not present in the TNG300-DM-3 paper, so standard conventions and reasonable defaults are used. FileWithInputSpectrum should be a CAMB/CLASS file matching the Planck 2015 cosmology (as in Table 1 of the paper). OutputList uses common snapshot scale factors; for exact TNG outputs, consult the TNG data release. Seed is set arbitrarily for reproducibility. All parameter names, types, and units are verified against the MP-Gadget manual. No required parameters are missing. This configuration is suitable for a DM-only run matching TNG300-DM-3."
