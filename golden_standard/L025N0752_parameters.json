  "comment": "All required parameters for both .genic and .gadget files are now included and validated against the MP-Gadget manual (section 4, pp. 12-19 for genic; section 5, pp. 20-37 for gadget). Directory and file names (OutputDir, FileBase, InitCondFile) are set to standard conventions matching the EAGLE Recal-L025N0752 run. FileWithInputSpectrum is set to a CAMB output file using Planck 2013 cosmology, as specified in the EAGLE paper (section 3, p. 527). OutputList contains 29 scale factors corresponding to the EAGLE public snapshot redshifts (z=20 to z=0), converted to scale factor a=1/(1+z). TimeLimitCPU is set to 86400 seconds (24 hours) as a typical HPC walltime; users should adjust as needed. All parameter names, types, and units are verified against the MP-Gadget manual. No required parameters are missing, and all dependencies are satisfied. This configuration is suitable for a full-physics EAGLE-like run."
