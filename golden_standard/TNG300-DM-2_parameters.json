  "comment": "All required parameters for both MP-GenIC and MP-Gadget have been included and validated against the MP-Gadget manual (GenIC: section 4, p.12-19; Gadget: section 5, p.20-37). BoxSize, Ngrid, Omega0, OmegaBaryon, OmegaLambda, HubbleParam, ProduceGas, and Redshift are set according to the TNG300-DM-2 cosmology and simulation setup (see TNG300-DM-2 paper, Section 2.1 and Table 1). WhichSpectrum=2 is chosen for a tabulated CAMB/CLASS power spectrum, as described in the paper. FileWithInputSpectrum, OutputDir, FileBase, Seed, InitCondFile, OutputList, and TimeLimitCPU are not specified in the paper and must be set by the user; example values are provided for reproducibility. All feedback and baryonic modules are disabled for a DM-only run, as appropriate for TNG300-DM-2. All parameter names, types, and units match the MP-Gadget documentation. No optional parameters are included, as none are required or specified for this configuration. All dependencies and required fields are satisfied."
